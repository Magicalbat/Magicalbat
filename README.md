# "If your goal is to learn about wheels, then there is nothing wrong with reinventing the wheel" - [Javidx9's friend Jack](https://youtu.be/HXSuNxpCzdM?t=155)
### This is a quote that I may have taken to heart a bit too much.

### Many of my smaller projects and be found on [Replit](https://replit.com/@Magicalbat?tab=repls)

## Current project - [Animated Presentation](https://github.com/Magicalbat/Animated-Presentation)
Inspired by [Mr 4th Programming](https://www.youtube.com/c/Mr4thProgramming/featured), I am currently working on an application for creating animated presentations. 
My goal is to learn about low level programming.
My current vision for the application is for it to present a presentation defined in a human-readable file format(similar to JSON).
It will look similar to something like Google Slides or Powerpoint, but will have a focus on *animations* and *extendibility* through a scripting language.
More far off goals would be to have a WASM port and an editor.

## Notible accomplishments
- [Neural Network](https://replit.com/@Magicalbat/Neural-Network#main.py) made from scratch (only using [numpy](https://numpy.org/))
- [Many game jams](https://magicalbat.itch.io/) using Unity, Godot, and Pygame. [Source code](https://github.com/Magicalbat/Pygame-Projects) for pygame games.
- TI 84 Plus CE applications(TODO: Add video here) using the [CE Programming Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain)

## Programming languages I know well
- C
- C++
- Python
- JavaScript (mainly canvas games)

## Programming languages I "know"
- Java
- C#
- Lua
- GDScript

## Future project ideas
- Neural Networks in scratch in C
- Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks
- Note taking app specifically for math with ML features
- Make my own [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) style single-header libraries
- General purpose pdf and note taking app
