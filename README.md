### Many of my smaller projects and be found on [Replit](https://replit.com/@Magicalbat?tab=repls)

## Current project - [Fractal Renderer](https://github.com/Magicalbat/Fractal-Renderer)
This is mainly to learn about how multi-precision numbers work.

## Notible accomplishments
- [mg-libraries](https://github.com/Magicalbat/mg-libraries), STB-style single-header libraries for C
- [Neural Network](https://replit.com/@Magicalbat/Neural-Network#main.py) made from scratch (only using [numpy](https://numpy.org/))
- [Many game jams](https://magicalbat.itch.io/) using Unity, Godot, and Pygame. [Source code](https://github.com/Magicalbat/Pygame-Projects) for pygame games
